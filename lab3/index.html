 <h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
<body>
	<p>The lab was made to have us learn more about creating a local file
		structure on our computer and add HTML files.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I have been having a hard time with HTML so this lab took lots of research,
		trial and error, and patience. I had issues inserting an image but figured it
		out through videos. I also had some trouble linking CSS files correctly.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The file that I made is the result of all of the trial and error that I went
		through. This is the file structure that I made:</p>

	<img src="img/Task 1 Lab 3.png" width=650/>
	<p>This is the first task on Lab 3. It is a screenshot showing my local file structure.</p>

	<h3>Task 2 Lab 3</h3>
	<img src="img/Task2 Lab 3.png" width=650/>
	<p>This is the second task on Lab 3. I created an index.html file in my art101 folder.</p>

	<h3>Task 3 Lab 3</h3>
	<img src="img/Task 3 Lab 3 part one.png" width=650/>
	<p>This is the third task in Lab 3. It is the index.html.</p>

	<h3>Task 3 Lab 3</h3>
	<img src="img/Task 3 Lab 3 part 2.png" width=650/>
	<p>This is the third task on Lab 3. It is a screenshot of the first part of this task previewed in the browser.</p>
